# Packages Intro

In addition to the CLI tool, calatrava is also a collection of packages that ship as dependencies of the initial boilerplate.

These packages cover everything from email to a DynamoDB wrapper and more.

They are grouped as their own packages in NPM for the sake of versioning and updating dependencies.

When you scaffold a new project you will be using the latest version of a package, but sometimes you might have to update.
