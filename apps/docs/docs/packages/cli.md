# @calatrava/cli

This package is the main package you run when you do an `npx @calatrava/cli init`. It is also a dependency of the initial boilerplate so that some of the package.json commands are simpler.

## Details

The package uses React Ink to show an interactive UI in the terminal. The UI asks for several details that it uses to configure the boilerplate and inject custom values such as the project name.

## Repository

The repository can be found at https://github.com/cmgriffing/calatrava/tree/main/packages/cli
