# @calatrava/arc-utils

This package is used to simplify management of the `app.arc` and `preferences.arc` files.

The app.arc can get fairly large in a significant REST API.

To manage this easier, Calatrava will use a template to inject indidivudal route `.arc` files as well as individual table and table-index `.arc` files.

## Repository
