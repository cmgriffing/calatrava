# init

The `init` command is responsible for scafolding out an initial boilerplate. It will prompt you for several pieces of information:

- project name
- output path (it will default to a new folder using a dasherized version of the project name)
- websocket support

## Usage

```sh
npx @calatrava/cli init
```

## Options

At this time, the cli does not take in any options since the config comes from the interactive prompted questions.
